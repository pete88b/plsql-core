        <h1>plsql-core: event_mediator</h1>
        
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>
            The event mediator module enables PL/SQL code to publish and receive
            events in a loosley coupled manner.
        </p>
        
        <h2>How to</h2>
        
        <h3>Receive notification of an event</h3>
    
        To receive notification of an event, register as an observer. e.g.
        <pre>
          BEGIN
            event_mediator.add_observer('task_complete', 'task_monitor');
          END;</pre>
        
        This would register the PL/SQL package task_monitor as an observer
        of the task_complete event.
        
    
        
        <h3>Notify observers of an event</h3>
    
        To notify observers of an event (i.e. publish an event), call event. e.g.

        <pre>
          PROCEDURE complete_admin_task(
            p_task_id IN INTEGER)

            ... code to complete the task ...

            event_mediator.event(
              'task_complete', 
              'task_complete(''admin'', ' || p_task_id || ')');

          END;

          PROCEDURE complete_other_task(
            p_task_id IN INTEGER)

            ... code to complete the task ...

            event_mediator.event(
              'task_complete', 
              'task_complete(''other'', ' || p_task_id || ')');

          END;</pre>
        
        Calling the <code>complete_admin_task</code> procedure (above) with a 
        <code>p_task_id</code> of 2, would cause event_mediator to call 
        <code>task_complete('admin', 2)</code> on all registered observers. 
        <br/>
        With task_monitor registered as an observer of the task_complete event, 
        this would mean executing 
        <pre>
          BEGIN 
            task_monitor.task_complete('admin', 2); 
          END;</pre>
          
        With no observers registered (as observers of the task_complete event)
        this would mean doing nothing.

        <h3>Remove an obsever</h3>
        
        To remove an obsever, call one of the remove_observer procedures. e.g.
        <pre>
          BEGIN
            event_mediator.remove_observer('task_complete', 'task_monitor');
          END;</pre>
        
        This will remove task_monitor as an observer of the task_complete event.

    
        <h2>Notes</h2>
    
        <p>
            Event names and observer names are converted to lower case for both
            storage and comparison.
        </p>
      
        <p>
            Observers must have publicly declared procedures that match the 
            signature of the event being published.
        </p>
      
        <p>
            Any number of observers can be registered to receive an event.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Any piece of PL/SQL code can publish an event.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Any number of events can be published under the same event name.
        </p>
