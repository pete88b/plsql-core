  /*
    This package provides a specification for logging facilities.
    
    The primary target use of this specification is to identify and resolve 
    run-time problems caused by PL/SQL code.
    
    
    When writing PL/SQL code, developers need to consider two situatons;
    
      Problems occur in the production environment.
        PL/SQL code must log enough information for support staff to be 
        able to identify the problem without re-creating the problem.
        i.e. Fist pass diagnostics.
        
        It is expected that the error procedure will be used to log this 
        information. 
        It is also expected that the info and warn procedures will be 
        used to help first pass diagnostics but data logged at these levels
        is not guaranteed to be saved.
        
      Problems occur in the development environment.
        PL/SQL code must log detailed information about what the code is doing
        so that developers can follow code execution.
        The following gives examples of the kind of information that will be 
        logged for this purpose;
          The start and end of a PL/SQL module,
          The values of actual parameters passed to PL/SQL modules,
          The route taken by code branches (IF / SWITCH / etc) ...
          
        It is expected that the fb, fb1 ... fb5, entering and exiting 
        procedures will be used to log this information.
        
        
    All data logged has an associated log level. The log level determines how 
    the logging call is dispatched.
    
      If the log level is greater than or equal to g_error_level, 
      logger_error.log is called.
      This is true regardless of the feedback level.
      
      Otherwise, if the log level is greater than or equal to the value returned
      by get_feedback_level, logger_feedback.log is called.
      i.e. All feedback could be suppressed by setting the feedback level to 
      6000.
      
      
    The implementations of logger_error and logger_feedback determine how data 
    is logged.
    
    
    Every call to any of the logging procedures (e.g. log, fb ... fb5, error) 
    will cause logger_utils.pre_log_process to be called before the logging 
    call is dispatched.
    
    
    Other modules required by this specification:
      logger_utils.pre_log_process
      logger_error.log(p_level IN PLS_INTEGER, p_data IN VARCHAR2)
      logger_feedback.log(p_level IN PLS_INTEGER, p_data IN VARCHAR2)
