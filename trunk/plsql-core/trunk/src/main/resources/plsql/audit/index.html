        <h1>plsql-core: auditer</h1>
        
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>
            The auditer module provides a way of maintaining a history of 
            changes made to data in database tables.
        </p>
        
        The primary goals of this module are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Provide a complete record of all changes made to table data 
                via the SQL commands DELETE, INSERT and UPDATE.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make it easy to enable auditing with minimal impact on existing 
                database objects.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make it easy to show who did what, when they did it and why they
                did it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="build_header">Build</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Build the logger module.</li>
            <li>Run build.sql (for the audit module).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How to</h2>
        
        <h3>Enable auditing</h3>
        
        <p>
            You need to <a href="#build_header">build</a> auditer first.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Auditing is enabled on a per <em>table</em> basis.
            To enable auditing for a table run the SQL*Plus script
            create_audit_trigger.
        </p>
        
        E.g. To enable auditing for the table countries that is owned by hr:
        
        <pre>
          SQL> @create_audit_trigger.sql hr countries
          
          Creating trigger hr.a$0

          PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
        </pre>
        
        
        <h3>Disable auditing</h3>
        
        <p>
            Auditing is disabled on a per <em>schema</em> basis.
            To disable auditing for a schema run the SQL*Plus script
            drop_audit_triggers.
        </p>
        
        E.g. To disable auditing for all tables owned by hr:
        
        <pre>
          SQL> @drop_audit_triggers.sql hr
          
          Droping trigger hr.a$0
          
          PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
        </pre>
        
        <p>
            <em>WARNING: </em> 
            If you are dropping triggers from a schema that is not the same as 
            the account you are logged in with, you may be told there are no
            triggers to drop even when there are triggers that could be dropped.
            This is because the drop script uses the view all_source, which
            will only show you source code that you have access to.
            If you can log on with a DBA account, you will not have this 
            problem.
        </p>
